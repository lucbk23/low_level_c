/*
 * Summary of How the Program Works:
 *
 * - **Hexadecimal Number (`x`):** The program starts with a long hexadecimal number that encodes a hidden message.
 * - **Decoding Process:**
 *     1. **Extracting Nibbles:** The program processes the number one nibble (4 bits) at a time.
 *     2. **Calculations:** Each nibble determines how the program will shift and mask the predefined constant to fetch the right bits.
 *     3. **Mapping to Characters:** The resulting value is adjusted to match the ASCII table, ensuring it corresponds to a readable character.
 * - **Output:** As each character is decoded, it is printed to the screen, revealing the hidden message.
 *
 * **Example Output:**
 * When you run the program, it will display:
 * 
 * Hello, World!
 * 
 * **Explanation:**
 * Each step in the loop deciphers a part of the hidden message by performing mathematical operations on binary data and translating it into text.
 *
 * **Potential Modifications:**
 *
 * - **Changing the Hidden Message:**
 *     - To display a different message, you would need to modify the initial hexadecimal number (`x`) and potentially the predefined constant (`0xC894A7B75116601`).
 *     - **Limitation:** The length of the message is tied to the number of hexadecimal digits in `x`. Each digit corresponds to one character in the output.
 *
 * - **Adjusting Text Length:**
 *     - **Shorter Text:** Use a hexadecimal number with fewer digits.
 *     - **Longer Text:** Use a hexadecimal number with more digits.
 *     - **Limitation:** The predefined constant must be large enough to accommodate the necessary bit shifts. If you increase the text length significantly, you might need to use a larger constant or adjust the shifting mechanism.
 *
 * - **Changing Characters:**
 *     - By altering how the shift and mask operations are performed, you can map different ranges of numbers to various characters.
 *     - **Limitation:** The program is designed to map values to standard printable ASCII characters. Extending beyond this range might result in non-printable or unintended characters.
 *
 * **Key Points to Remember:**
 *
 * - **Hexadecimal to Binary:** Hexadecimal numbers are a shorthand for binary representations, making them easier to read and manage in code.
 * - **Bitwise Operations:** Shifting and masking are fundamental operations that help in extracting specific parts of binary data.
 * - **ASCII Mapping:** Adding 32 ensures that the resulting numbers correspond to printable characters in the ASCII table.
 *
 * This structured approach allows users with a basic understanding to grasp how binary data can be manipulated and translated into human-readable text.
